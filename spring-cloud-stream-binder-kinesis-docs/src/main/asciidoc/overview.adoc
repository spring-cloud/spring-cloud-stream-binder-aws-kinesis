This guide describes the AWS Kinesis implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream Binder.
It contains information about its design, usage and configuration options, as well as information on how the Stream Cloud Stream concepts map into AWS Kinesis specific constructs.
--

== Usage

For using the AWS Kinesis Binder, you just need to add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, using the following Maven coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-kinesis</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Alternatively, you can also use the Spring Cloud Stream Kinesis Starter.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-kinesis</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Kinesis Binder Overview

A simplified diagram of how the Kinesis binder operates can be seen below.

The Kinesis Binder implementation maps each destination to a `Stream`.

== Configuration Options

This section contains settings specific to the Kinesis Binder and bound channels.

For general binding configuration options and properties, please refer to the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-core-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-stream-overview.adoc#configuration-options[Spring Cloud Stream core documentation].
